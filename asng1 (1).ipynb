    "(d)Booleans   (e)Dictionary (f)List\n",
    "(g)set\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)Intiger-In Python, integers are zero, positive or negative whole numbers without a fractional part\n",
    "and having unlimited precision, e.g. 0, 100, -10. The followings are valid integer literals in Python.\n",
    "Integers can be binary, octal, and hexadecimal values. All integer literals or variables are objects of the int class.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)Floating Point Number-The float type in Python represents the floating point number.\n",
    "Float is used to represent real numbers and is written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts.\n",
    "For example, 97.98, 32.3+e18, -32.54e100 all are floating point numbers.\n",

    "(d)Booleans-Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false).\n",
    "But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false.\n",
    "It is denoted by the class bool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note – True and False with capital ‘T’ and ‘F’ are valid booleans otherwise python will throw an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e)Dictionary- Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map,\n",
    "which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. \n",
    "Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f)list-A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, \n",
    "or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item.\n",
    "Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].\n",
    "\n",
    "(g)Set-Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.\n",
    "Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data,\n",
    "the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.\n",
    "A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q(4) What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans(4)-An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators,\n",
    "and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language,\n",
